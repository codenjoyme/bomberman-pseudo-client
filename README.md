    ☼ &  #☼
    ☼ ☼#☼ ☼
    ☼     ☼
    ☼☺☼#☼ ☼

    ☼☼☼☼☼☼☼
    Answer: UP
    ```
   
## Write your bot logic
	
1. Open `\rules\main.rules` file as text

2. Now you can write your script to control the hero on the map. How? It's pretty simple. 

3. If you change anything, just save the file and your hero will follow the new directions. Look carefully at this file, this is your field for pseudo coding. Your control panel.

4. You can make a mistake during "programming" your hero. Don’t worry, we will let you know exactly where and why it happened - check command post.

    ```
    [ERROR] Pattern is not valid: '???wrong?☺????' at C:\bomberman-pseudo-client-portable\rules\main.rule:91
    ``` 

##	How to write your rules?

1. There are **SEVERAL TYPES** of command which you can use, check `*.rules` file.

2. Indicate what the space around the hero should look like, and then indicate the direction of movement of the hero. 

    * Your hero is indicated by the symbol `☺` 

    * The space (mask/pattern/frame) around the hero should be **SQUARE** forms of any size, it does not matter where the hero is located (in the center of the mask or on its border)

      In this example we are interested in what is in 1 cell around the hero

       ```
        ☼  
        ☼☺☼
        ☼  
       ```

      In this example we are interested in what is in 2 cells around the hero

        ```
        ☼☼ ☼#
        ☼☼   
        ☼☼☺☼#
        ☼☼   
        ☼☼☼☼☼
        ```

      In this example we are interested in what is in the upper left corner of the hero

        ```
         ☼#
       
        ☺☼#
        ```

    * The next line after the mask indicate the direction of hero's movement - one of the commands: `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN` or the `ACT` command - put the bomb

      If the picture around the hero looks like this mask, he will run up

      ```
      ☼  
      ☼☺☼
      ☼  
      UP
      ```

      And in this case (if nothing prevents the hero) he will go down

      ```
      ☼ ☼
       ☺ 
      ☼ ☼
      DOWN
      ```
   
3. Left bomb will explode after 5 ticks (1 tick - 1 second) and the blast wave will destroy everyone who touches. 

4. You can also specify not 1 action, but several separated by commas. This will mean that when a given mask is triggered, the specified tick-by-tick commands will be processed. For example, in the example below, if the hero sees a bomb to his left, then he first goes to the right, and then hides up from the blast wave.

    ```
    ☼☼☼☼
    ☼ ☼ 
    ☼5☺ 
    ☼ ☼ 
    ☼☼☼☼
    RIGHT,UP
    ```

5. It often happens that you don’t know what symbol will be at this particular point, and you want to generalize. To do this, you have a symbol that means any possible symbol `?` at this point. The past example will be more universal, if described as follows.

    ```
    ????
    ??? 
    ?5☺ 
    ????
    ????
    RIGHT,UP

    ????
    ????
    ?5☺ 
    ??? 
    ????
    RIGHT,DOWN

    ????
    ?? ?
    ?5☺?
    ????
    ????
    UP

    ????
    ????
    ?5☺?
    ?? ?
    ????
    DOWN
    ```

6. It is **IMPORTANT** to understand that the first matched mask will work out in the list of commands and further verification will not be carried out.

7. The legend of possible symbols

    ```
    /// This is your Bomberman
    BOMBERMAN('☺'),             // this is what he usually looks like
    BOMB_BOMBERMAN('☻'),        // this is if he is sitting on own bomb
    DEAD_BOMBERMAN('Ѡ'),        // oops, your Bomberman is dead (don't worry, he will appear somewhere in next move)
                                // you're getting penalty points for each death

    /// this is other players Bombermans
    OTHER_BOMBERMAN('♥'),       // this is what other Bombermans looks like
    OTHER_BOMB_BOMBERMAN('♠'),  // this is if player just set the bomb
    OTHER_DEAD_BOMBERMAN('♣'),  // enemy corpse (it will disappear shortly, right on the next move)
                                // if you've done it you'll get score points

    /// the bombs
    BOMB_TIMER_5('5'),          // after bomberman set the bomb, the timer starts (5 ticks)
    BOMB_TIMER_4('4'),          // this will blow up after 4 tacts
    BOMB_TIMER_3('3'),          // this after 3
    BOMB_TIMER_2('2'),          // two
    BOMB_TIMER_1('1'),          // one
    BOOM('҉'),                  // Boom! this is what is bomb does, everything that is destroyable got destroyed

    /// walls
    WALL('☼'),                  // indestructible wall - it will not fall from bomb
    DESTROYABLE_WALL('#'),      // this wall could be blowed up
    DESTROYED_WALL('H'),        // this is how broken wall looks like, it will dissapear on next move
                                // if it's you did it - you'll get score points.

    /// meatchoppers
    MEAT_CHOPPER('&'),          // this guys runs over the board randomly and gets in the way all the time
                                // if it will touch bomberman - it will die
                                // you'd better kill this piece of ... meat, you'll get score points for it
    DEAD_MEAT_CHOPPER('x'),     // this is chopper corpse

    /// a void
    NONE(' ');                 // this is the only place where you can move your Bomberman
    ```
   
8. There are occasions when it is necessary to combine several characters into one group. To do this, use the `LET directive A = QWERTYUIOP`, where `A `is the character that can be used in the mask after the `LET` command, and `QWERTYUIOP` are the characters that will be substituted for `A`. For example, we can generalize our past example with saving from the bomb so that the hero does not run away only from a bomb with a timer of `5`, but also from `4`, `3`, `2` and `1`.

    ```
    LET B=54321

    ????
    ??? 
    ?B☺ 
    ????
    ????
    RIGHT,UP

    ????
    ????
    ?B☺ 
    ??? 
    ????
    RIGHT,DOWN

    ????
    ?? ?
    ?B☺?
    ????
    ????
    UP

    ????
    ????
    ?B☺?
    ?? ?
    ????
    DOWN
    ```
    
9. In some cases, you may need to place part of the behavior script in a separate file. For example, if there is no bomb, we do one action, but if the bomb appears, we run away. To do this, instead of a specific command `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN` or `ACT`, you should specify the RULE directive:

    ```
    &☺
    ??
    RULE runAway.rule

    ☺&
    ??
    RULE runAway.rule

    ??
    ☺&
    RULE runAway.rule

    ??
    &☺
    RULE runAway.rule
    ```
   
    In this script, we said that if a hunter appears around our hero, we must run. And how to run is described in the `runAway.rule` file. If you need to, create it! Inside the new script, you can write everything the same as in the main `main.rule` script.

10. **DO NOT FORGET** that each mask should be square (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5). 

11. Also, **WATCH CAREFULLY** for the symbols ` `  - this is an empty space on the field that is not occupied by anything. The space character ` `  is easy to skip (or add some redundant), so check back carefully.

12. The order of the commands depends on the order of their execution. Possible overlap - one command / rule overlaps another.

## Other stuff

1. All participants play on the same field. The winner is the one who for the given time will earn the most points.

2. For the destruction of the destructible wall you will get `+10`

3. If you manage to catch the hunter you will receive `+100`

4. If you manage to catch another bomberman, you will get `+1000`
